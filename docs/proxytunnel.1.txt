== NAME
proxytunnel - program to tunnel a connection through a standard HTTPS proxy


== SYNOPSIS
*proxytunnel* _[OPTION]_...


== DESCRIPTION
*proxytunnel* is a program to tunnel any connection through a standard HTTPS
proxy, circumventing standard HTTP filtering mechanisms. It's mostly used as
a backend for OpenSSH's ProxyCommand, and as a proxy backend for Putty. It can
also be used for other proxy-traversing purposes like proxy bouncing.


== OPTIONS

*-i*, *--inetd*::
    Run from inetd (default: off)

*-a*, *--standalone*=_port_::
    Run as standalone daemon on specified _port_

*-p*, *--proxy*=_host_:_port_::
    Use _host_ and _port_ as the local proxy to connect to, if not specified
    the *HTTP_PROXY* environment variable, if set, will be used instead

*-r*, *--remproxy*=_host_:_port_::
    Use _host_ and _port_ as the remote (secondary) proxy to connect to

*-d*, *--dest*=_host_:_port_::
    Use _host_ and _port_ as the destination for the tunnel, you can also
    specify them as the argument to the proxytunnel command

*-e*, *--encrypt*::
    SSL encrypt data between local proxy and destination

*-E*, *--encrypt-proxy*::
    SSL encrypt data between client and local proxy

*-X*, *--encrypt-remproxy*::
    SSL encrypt data between local and remote (secondary) proxy


== ADDITIONAL OPTIONS

*-F*, *--passfile*=_filename_::
    Use _filename_ for reading username and password for HTTPS proxy
    authentication, the file uses the same format as .wgetrc and can be shared
    with wget. Use this option, or environment variables to hide the password
    from other users

*-P*, *--proxyauth*=_username_:_password_::
    Use _username_ and _password_ as credentials to authenticate against a
    local HTTPS proxy, the username and password can also be specified in
    the *PROXYUSER* and *PROXYPASS* environment variables to hide them from
    other users.
    If the _password_ is ommited and no *PROXYPASS* environment variable is
    set, proxytunnel will prompt for a password

*-R*, *--remproxyauth*=_username_:_password_::
    Use _username_ and _password_ as credentials to authenticate against a
    remote (secondary) HTTPS proxy, the username and password can also be
    specified in the *REMPROXYUSER* and *REMPROXYPASS* environment variables
    to hide them from other users.
    If the _password_ is ommited and no *REMPROXYPASS* environment variable is
    set, proxytunnel will prompt for a password

*-N*, *--ntlm*::
    Use NTLM basd authentication

*-t*, *--domain*=_STRING_::
    Specify NTLM domain (default: autodetect)

*-H*, *--header*=_STRING_::
    Add additional HTTP headers to send to proxy

*-x*, *--proctitle*=_STRING_::
    Use a different process title


== MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS

*-v*, *--verbose*::
    Turn on verbosity

*-q*, *--quiet*::
    Suppress messages

*-h*, *--help*::
    Print help and exit

*-V*, *--version*::
    Print version and exit


== ARGUMENTS
_host_:_port_ is the destination hostname and port number combination

NOTE: Specifying the destination as arguments is exactly the same as
specifying them using the *-d* or *--dest* option.


== USAGE
Depending on your situation you might want to do any of the following things:

 * *Connect through a local proxy to your home system on port 22*

   $ proxytunnel -v -p proxy.company.com:8080 -d system.home.nl:22

 * *Connect through a local proxy (with authentication) to your home system*

   $ proxytunnel -v -p proxy.company.com:8080 -P username:password -d system.home.nl:22

 * *Connect through a local proxy (with authentication) hiding your password*

   $ export PROXYPASS=password
   $ proxytunnel -v -p proxy.company.com:8080 -P username -d system.home.nl:22

 * *Connect through a local proxy to a remote proxy and bounce to any system*

   $ proxytunnel -v -p proxy.company.com:8080 -r proxy.athome.nl:443 -d system.friend.nl:22

 * *Connect using SSL through a local proxy to your home system*

   $ proxytunnel -v -E -p proxy.company.com:8080 -d system.home.nl:22


== OPENSSH CONFIGURATION
To use this program with OpenSSH to connect to a host somewhere, create a
_~/.ssh/config_ file with the following content:

----
Host system.athome.nl
    ProxyCommand proxytunnel -p proxy.company.com:8080 -d %h:%p
    ServerAliveInterval 30
----

NOTE: The +ServerAliveInterval+ directive makes sure that idle connections are
not being dropped by intermediate firewalls that remove active sessions
aggresively. If you see your connection dropping out, try to lower the value
even more.

To use the dynamic (SOCKS) portforwarding capability of the SSH client, you
can specify the +DynamicForward+ directive in your ssh_config file like:

----
Host system.athome.nl
    DynamicForward 1080
    ProxyCommand proxytunnel -p proxy.company.com:8080 -d %h:%p
    ServerAliveInterval 30
----


== NOTES
IMPORTANT: Most HTTPS proxies do not allow access to ports other than HTTPS
(tcp/443) and SNEWS (tcp/563). In this case you need to make sure the SSH
daemon or remote proxy on the destination system is listening on either
tcp/443 or tcp/563 to get through.


== ENVIRONMENT
Proxytunnel can be influenced by setting one of the following environment
variables:

*HTTP_PROXY*::
    If this environment variable is set, proxytunnel will use it as the
    _local proxy_ if *-p* or *--proxy* is not provided

*PROXYUSER*::
    If this environment variable is set, proxytunnel will use it as the
    _username_ for proxy authentication, unless specified using the *-P* or
    *--proxyauth* option

*PROXYPASS*::
    If this environment variable is set, proxytunnel will use it as the
    _password_ for proxy authentication, unless specified using the *-P* or
    *--proxyauth* option

*REMPROXYUSER*::
    If this environment variable is set, proxytunnel will use it as the
    _username_ for remote (secondary) proxy authentication, unless specified
    using the *-R* or *--remproxyauth* option

*REMPROXYPASS*::
    If this environment variable is set, proxytunnel will use it as the
    _password_ for remote (secondary) proxy authentication, unless specified
    using the *-R* or *--remproxyauth* option

== BUGS
This software is bug-free, at least we'd like to think so. If you do not
agree with us, please attach the proof to your friendly email :)
